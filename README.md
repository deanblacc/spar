Spar is a card game (from ghana). Wrote this to learn how to design RESTful system. So far written only the server side code. Client side code for iOS, Android and the web is yet to be written.

##Technologies Used
#### Dropwizard 
* RESTful web service for java. Simple and easy to use.

#### RabbitMq
* Messaging bus. Used to send messages between devices. Chose this messaging platform because it has an extensive client library for different languages

#### Gradle
* Build tool. Cleaner the and just better than maven (IMHO)

#### Heroku
* Services deployed on heroku

#### Mulesoft Raml Console
* To display list of API commands. Note the console is purposely pointed against localhost instead of my heroku instance in order not to execute against my prod instance.  

##How to use
* The API can be seen here http://www.gamegbee.com/.
